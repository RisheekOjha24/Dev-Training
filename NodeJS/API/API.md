# API (Application Programming Interface):

An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, as well as how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.
