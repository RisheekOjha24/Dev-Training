Static Typing:
In statically typed languages, the type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that variable types must be explicitly declared, and type checking occurs during compilation.

ex: int number = 10;  // Declaring an integer variable
number = "Hello"; // Compilation error: incompatible types


Dynamic Typing
In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime. This means that variables can hold values of any type, and type checking occurs during execution.

let number = 10;  // Declaring a variable with an integer value
number = "Hello"; // No error; variable can now hold a string
console.log(number); // Output: "Hello"
