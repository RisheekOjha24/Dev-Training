Transpiling is the process of converting source code from one higher level language to another higher level language while preserving the original code's functionality.
 It is commonly used to convert modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) into older versions (like ES5) that are compatible with more browsers.

 Babel is a widely used JavaScript transpiler that converts ES6 (and above) code into a backward-compatible version of JavaScript.
