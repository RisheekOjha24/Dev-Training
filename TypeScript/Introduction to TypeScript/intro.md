TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, making your code safer and easier to manage, especially for large projects.

Advantages of TypeScript:

1. Type Safety: Catch type-related errors early.
2. Better Tooling: Enhanced IntelliSense, autocompletion, and debugging.
3. OOP Features: Supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
4. Great for Large Projects: Makes refactoring and scaling easier
